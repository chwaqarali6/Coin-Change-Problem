# Coin-Change-Problem
You often need to convert Rupees into coins of 5, 2, and 1. You task is to develop a C++ program to compute a mix of coins of 5, 2 and 1 against the given amount of money. Remember that you may not always have enough coins. So the program should be able to covert the money into the coins available. For example, if you don’t have the coins of 5-rupees, then for 7 rupees the program should compute a mix of 2-rupees and 1-rupee coins. The program should also take as input the number of 5-rupees, 2-rupees and 1-rupee coins available. The program should display the amount of money in terms of numbers of 5-rupees coins, 2-rupees coins and 1-rupee coins if possible with the available set of coins. Otherwise print the message “Sorry!! No such combination exists".
